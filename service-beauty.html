                <h4>Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Injections/ Vampire Facial</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fine lines and sagging skin around your eyes, cheeks, and mouth? Puffiness and dark circles below your eyes? Skin not as smooth as desired? Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy or the “Vampire Facial” is your best solution to these problems. PRP is an advanced treatment that uses ingredients already contained in your blood in order to regenerate your skin and revitalize collagen. The result? – healthy, younger looking skin. </li>
                    <li>Scientific studies have shown that PRP generates new collagen when infused into the skin. New studies reveal that PRP can also ease sun damage and aging skin problems. Because PRP therapy uses your own blood, it is 100% natural. As part of the process, a small amount of blood with a high concentration of stem cells, growth factors, and platelets is injected into your skin and stimulates the growth of new collagen. As a result, wrinkles are reduced and your skin is left naturally smooth and firm.</li>
                    <li>Because PRP is derived from your own blood, there is almost no risk of allergic reaction with this treatment and there is no downtime.</li>

                <h4>Botox®</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you want a guaranteed and proven way to eliminate facial wrinkles, look no further than Botox®. Botox® is by far the most popular cosmetic procedure. Botox® is best suited to address forehead lines, lines between the eyebrows, lines beside the eyes, and lines around the mouth and lips. </li>
                    <li>Botox® is also helpful for treating muscle spasms, excessive sweating (see our </li>
                    <li>Hyperhidrosis Botox® service), migraines, and upper motor neuron syndrome. Once injected, Botox® blocks impulses from certain facial nerves so that other muscles are able to pull the skin tighter. Botox® treatments take about 15 minutes and requires no anaesthetic. One of our medical professionals will discuss your treatments goals and identify the points of injection best suited for the results you desire.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Hyperhidrosis Botox®</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hyperhidrosis is commonly known as excessive sweating, which can occur in various parts of the body. Studies have found that excessive sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. The FDA has approved Botox® injections for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Botox® blocks the chemical signals from the nerves to your sweat glands and once your sweat glands cannot receive such signals, no more excessive sweating.</li>
                    <li>A Hyperhidrosis Botox® treatment takes about one hour and can reduce excessive sweating by about 80% within one month of the first treatment. One treatment can last for more than 6.5 months.</li>

                    <h4>Kybella®</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Say goodbye to your double chin with Kybella®. Kybella® is an FDA-approved injection that eliminates the fat below the chin. This stubborn fat exists in all types of people and can be caused by age, genetics, diet, and a variety of other factors. The quick, non-surgical injection, destroys the fat cells and leaves your chin and jawline area looking slimmer and more youthful.</li>
                        <li>Synthetic deoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring molecule in your body that aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat and is the active ingredient contained in Kybella®. Deoxycholic acid has been clinically tested and FDA approved. This powerful molecule breaks down the cell membranes of your fat cells and dissolves the fat gradually over the span of several weeks.</li>
                        <li>Based on your specific body and your goals, our medical professionals will work with you to determine how many Kybella® treatments are right for you. Most clients receive 2-3 treatments and each treatment is given at least one month apart. Kybella® results are permanent.</li>

Dysport® temporarily smoothens skin by blocking the signal from your nerves to your muscles to temporarily prevent the treated muscle from contracting and exaggerating the degree of your wrinkles. Dysport® is a botulinum neurotoxin, an acetylcholine release inhibitor and a neuromuscular blocking agent. You will start to see results after 2-3 days and results last up to 4 months.</li>

                <h4>Micro Needling</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Micro Needling, also known as, Collagen Induction Therapy (CIT), may be performed anywhere on your body. Micro Needling is great for fine lines, wrinkles scars, stretch marks, large pores, dark under eye circles, hyper and hypo pigmentation, and other skin imperfections. During the procedure, an electric needling device stimulates the production of collagen and elastin in your skin. When the needles gently break the skin, they break down scar tissue to create tiny channels that absorb topical products and platelet-rich plasma deep into the layers of your skin. This process promotes new growth of skin cells to fill in skin imperfections and smooth out your skin, resulting in a more refreshed, younger appearance. There is little to no downtime or recovery for Micro Needling and no scars from the process are left behind. Micro Needling can be performed on both men and women and on all skin types.</li>
                    <li>There is little to no discomfort during the procedure, with some areas being more sensitive than others. Numbing agents can be applied.</li>
                    <li>Most clients need about 2-3 treatments scheduled 6-8 weeks apart, but individual results can vary. After Micro Needling you will notice an immediately glow to your skin and visible results develop over the course of several weeks.</li>
